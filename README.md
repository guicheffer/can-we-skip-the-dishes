### Choice of Stack
- react-toolbox
	- I already used in live projects and it worths for small applications which there are many components that could reused or anything like this BUT I still think a minor and default styleguide needs to be implemented such as our given `src/app/styleguide/*`
- react
	- ...
- redux
	- ...
- webpack
	- ...
- stylus
	- ...

‚¨ÜÔ∏è explain those later

I'm sorry for not completing the test, there were too details I wanted to adjust, that's why I got lost in time.

BUT!

I would certainly add the missing features if I had focused on the architecture, instead only of the client-side details.
